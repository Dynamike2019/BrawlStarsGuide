This is very useful as it allows her to stun them out of their supers and attacks, and it also helps her escape enemy brawlers. Her super shoots a giant ball of gum that bounces off walls and deals damage to enemies everytime it hits them. Bibi has one star power: "Home Run", which means that when her Home Run Bar is charged, her movement speed is increased from 770 points to 800 points, allowing her to get to enemy brawlers, escape, or reach helpful items first. At power level 1, Bibi has 4400 health and deals 1300 damage per swing. At power level 10, or max level, Bibi has 6160 health, and deals 1820 damage per swing.
