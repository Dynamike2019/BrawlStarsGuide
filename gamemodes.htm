      <p>In Brawl Stars, there are 10 game modes: Gem Grab, Solo Showdown, Duo Showdown, Heist, Bounty, Brawl Ball, Seige, Robo Rumble, Big Game, and Boss Fight. When the player starts Brawl Stars, Gem Grab is already unlocked. Once the player reaches 30 trophies, Solo Showdown and Duo Showdown are unlocked. At 150 trophies, Daily Events are unlocked. Daily Events include: Heist, Bounty, and Brawl Ball. Later on at 350 tropphies, Ticket Events are unlocked, which are: Robo Rumble, Big Game, and Boss Fight. Finally, at 800 trophies, the one Special Event: Seige, is unlocked. Once 800 trophies are hit, all the game modes are unlocked. </p>

There are boxes which give players power cubes, and power cubes increase health and damage. Characters fight until there is only one brawler left, and that brawler wins. Winning game modes gives trophies, and the lower the rank, the more trophies gained. During a match, smoke slowly closes in, and when players are in the smoke, they lose 1000 health per second, so it forces them towards the middle. Duo Showdown is the same thing as Solo Showdown, except there are two people on 1 team, and there are 5 teams.

The objective of the game is to pick up 10 gems, and hold them on your side for 15 seconds. If both teams are tied at 10 gems, then the countdown resets, and whoever gets ahead first and beats the 15 second countdown wins.

The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy safe, and the game mode lasts for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. If a team destroys the enemy safe before the countdown is over, the game is over. But if no teams destroy the enemy safe before the countdown ends, the team that got the most damage wins. If they are tied, then it is a draw, and no teams win.</p>

The objective of the game is to kill the enemy team, and there are two teams, each with 3 players. At the beginning, each player is worth 2 stars, but with each kill, a star is added on to the players stars, making him worth 3 stars, and so on, until 7. But if that player is killed, the stars are added to the enemy team, and the players stars reset to 2. Whoever has the most stars at the end of the two minutes wins, and if they tie, then they have a draw.

There are two teams, each with 3 players. There are obstacles, and each team can kill other players on the other team. The objective of the game is to score two goals, and each game is 2 minutes and 30 seconds long. If the teams are tied after the countdown ends, all the obstacles on the map will be destroyed, and it will become overtime. If it is still tied at the end of overtime, and no teams score two goals, then it becomes a draw and no one wins.
